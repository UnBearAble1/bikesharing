## Summary

While the information from New York City is informative, huge questions remain around it suitability for Des Moines and if it will turn a profit for the investors. For future studies, it would be useful to know how the demographics of Des Moines compare with NYC and if there is a suitable population in Des Moines that would use or subscribe to citibike to turn a profit. 

A second good study would be to determine the costs of upkeep and loss of the bikes. While there is information on the biek usage and wear and tear, the costs around ensuring bikes are reliable and in good condition for customers and subscribers would be useful for the investors.
