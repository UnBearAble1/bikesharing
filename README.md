# CitiBike Sharing Suitability Study for Des Moines

## Overview of the analysis

This study reviews citibike's bike sharing information from New York City to determine if the service can find a suitable market in Des Monies Iowa. Public data was taken from citibike to review its operation in NYC and various slides were prepared to show bike utilization and some demographic information on those using the service

## Results

The first item reviewed was trip duration. A large amount of trips are under 20 minutes and the vast majority under one hour.

Third was the heavy hours of use for the service. Heavy hours of use show the service is used during commuting hours, potentially as an alternative to driving. Weekend use is spread out during daytime hours

The next item reviewed was a break out of utilization between single use customers and subscribers during the week, also broken out by gender. Following the trend, male subscribers make up the large majority of users. Subscribers also use the service more than customers, though customers peak during the weekends

To further determine the suitability of Des Moines, the trip starting and ending locations were shown. This can be used to see if Des Moines has a similar area that could experience similar usage.

Trips start centralized in this area

## Summary

While the information from New York City is informative, huge questions remain around it suitability for Des Moines and if it will turn a profit for the investors. For future studies, it would be useful to know how the demographics of Des Moines compare with NYC and if there is a suitable population in Des Moines that would use or subscribe to citibike to turn a profit. 

A second good study would be to determine the costs of upkeep and loss of the bikes. While there is information on the bike usage and wear and tear, the costs around ensuring bikes are reliable and in good condition for customers and subscribers would be useful for the investors.
